**HealthDataNet**

Part 1 - Proposal Submission
Name of Project: **HealthDataNet**

### Proposal in one sentence: 

Allow a private dataset, resembling aggregated healthcare data, to be stored on Filecoin Plus, enclose it in an additional privacy 'bubble', publish its metadata on the Ocean marketplace, and provide the output of a relevant compute-to-data algorithm run on this dataset to an authorized Ocean marketplace customer.

### Description of the project and what problem is it solving: 

#### Problem to be solved: 
Under US law (HIPAA, Hitech Act), healthcare companies involved in direct patient care are required to maintain data collected by them for every patient. Storing certain kinds of medical data indefinitely / for long periods of time is expensive, especially if it generates no returns for money spent on storage. Furthermore, this data is locked within individual company data silos. These isolated data silos lack statistical power, and the companies have no mechanism to cooperate on combining and analyzing this data for different insights. 

For example, this situation is true for several companies that are part of the intra-operative surgical monitoring industry in which the project lead (ASG) has worked for several years. Each individual company has a dataset that by itself is inadequate for machine learning algorithms, but several such company datasets together, can provide insights. Yet these companies are unable to share data between themselves since this might provide crucial business intelligence to their competitors. 

#### Solution:
We propose a data storage, analytics and monetization **paradigm** for aggregated private healthcare data that focuses on patient privacy, data provenance and traceable, controlled compute-to-data. 
The proposed paradigm should include an inexpensive, decentralized storage solution (e.g. Filecoin), absolute control of data in the hands of the individual data providing company with fine-grained layers of privacy provided by Ocean Protocol and Datona Labs. Furthermore, the providers should be able to publish their dataset attributes / metadata with compute-to-data permissions on the Ocean Marketplace. A HealthDataNet / data provider authorized customer will be allowed to run compute-to-data ML algorithms on these datasets and to access the predictive models / insights outputted by the algorithm. A similar federated learning solution called [Melloddy](https://www.melloddy.eu/), but based on centralized data storage at AWS, is currently being piloted for large pharmaceutical companies.

Our long-term goal is to become a nationally accredited, specialized service providing healthcare companies with storage, analytics and monetization of their data on the Ocean Marketplace, while ensuring patient rights and privacy. Funds requested in this proposal will allow us to develop a *proof-of-concept* of such a service paradigm.

### Which category best describes your project? Pick one.

Other / core tech / community 

### Which Fundamental Metric best describes your project? 
Pick one.

Other - Our end goal is to unlock value in US healthcare data silos with Ocean Protocol based technology. As a first step, we wish to create a proof-of-concept of a paradigm to store, analyze and monetize these datasets for their aggregators and **ultimately provide control to each patient over their own data** going forward.

Core tech: We will demonstrate how the Ocean Marketplace can be integrated with decentralized data storage services like Filecoin.

Community: By establishing this paradigm for private, regulated, healthcare data storage and monetization via the Ocean Marketplace, we will enable the Ocean community to develop similar solutions in other areas of healthcare as well as other regulated and privacy sensitive industries (e.g. legal).

### What is the final product?: 
A proof-of-concept of a storage and monetization paradigm using compute-to-data on privately stored aggregate healthcare datasets.

### How does this project drive value to the “fundamental metric” (listed above) and the overall Ocean ecosystem? 

This is best expressed as Expected ROI

#### Expected ROI:
Anecdotal reports from a health data company CEO (the Health Unchained podcast, episode 7, Jul 2, 2018) suggest a single health PHR (personal health record) was being sold for ~ 1200 USD in data marketplaces. The legality of these transactions are unclear, but indicates the value of such data. 
The largest neurophysiology companies provide services in ~ 100,000 cases a year, and the combined case coverage for companies based in the US is ~ 750,000 [cases](https://ionm.uconn.edu/). If a company decides to use our paradigm, they will bring their entire database of several thousand patients to Ocean. Furthermore, the datasets will have an annual growth of several thousand cases.
Although the total case volume is large, the types of cases (e.g. neck, thorax, low back, brain aneurysms, tumors etc) being covered are many and the patient population is varied. Hence an individual company lacks the ability to collect sufficient data for machine learning.
We expect the Ocean, as well as, the larger AI/ML community will develop several novel uses for this expanding healthcare dataset.

### Proposal Details

Allied health care providers range from anesthesiology service provider companies all the way to environmental services provider companies in the United States. A vast army of these companies provide services to U.S. hospitals. Many different types of companies are involved in direct patient care and are required to store PHI (protected health information) data by law. 

Surgical neurophysiology companies are an example of allied health provider companies. Large neurophysiology companies are unique in having nationwide coverage. Surgical neurophysiology companies provide their services for surgeries involving the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves and many types of vascular (involving heart, major blood vessels including those in the brain) surgeries. There are approximately 750,000 such surgeries performed annually in the United States and this case coverage is growing every year. 

During surgery, the surgical neurophysiologist present in the operating room records neurophysiological data from the patient and runs tests at the request of the surgeon. This allows the surgeon to operate avoiding injury to neural tissue. For example, during brain tumor surgeries, a surgeon needs the neurophysiologist to guide him by identifying brain areas involved in movement, sensation, vital bodily functions (breathing etc). Large amounts of neurophysiological data are collected and needs to be stored as PHI by the company that employs the neurophysiologist.

The outcome of these types of surgeries are dependent on several features of the patient’s medical history as well as the intra-operative course of the surgery. Potentially, this data when subject to machine learning, will unlock new insights into surgical outcomes. Unfortunately, machine learning models are data hungry, and no individual company can generate sufficient data on the many different types of surgeries performed. They need to collaborate amongst each other but are wary of this due to competition. We hope to provide a collaborative mechanism while simultaneously providing a new revenue stream for each company in the marketplace. In addition, machine learning developers and other entities (e.g. insurance companies) will also benefit from compute-to-data access to real patient data.

Using their experience and connections in the surgical neurophysiology field, the built-out core team will network with large and small surgical neurophysiology company executives. The US Northeast, where the project lead is based, is at the forefront of this field and sets the ‘standard of service’ for other regions of the country. 

Using inputs from these stakeholders and after consultation / collaboration with the Ocean Protocol developer community, the team will outline legal and realistic solution/s to these problems based on the paradigm described above. The uniqueness of the paradigm resides in its decentralized nature (no single target), immutability, access tracking and compute-to-data capabilities that preserve patient rights and privacy.

### Project Deliverables

#### Any prior work completed thus far? 

The project lead has published two test datasets (vital_signs_1 & 2) on the Ocean Marketplace using the Rinkeby network. He is currently working on learning to develop and publish an appropriate compute-to-data ML algorithm. To achieve this, he is contributing to the Algovera AI hacking sessions actively.

#### What is the project roadmap? tbd

That is: what are key milestones, and the target date for each milestone.


#### Final delivery of proof-of-concept paradigm : May 2022

### Please include the team's future plans and intentions.

We believe a successful implementation of this paradigm in the neurophysiology field will kindle interest amongst other types of health provider companies (e.g. anesthesia providers that typically work closely with surgical neurophysiologists in the operating room) and stimulate their adoption of Ocean Protocol.

Our mission is to become an Ocean Protocol based b2b service provider for healthcare data assets and analytic solutions while ensuring patient rights and privacy.
