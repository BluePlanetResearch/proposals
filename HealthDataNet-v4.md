**HealthDataNet**

Part 1 - Proposal Submission Name of Project: **HealthDataNet**

Proposal in one sentence:

Allow a private dataset to be stored on Filecoin Plus, enclose it in an
additional privacy ‘bubble’, publish it on the Ocean marketplace, and
provide the output of a compute-to-data algorithm run on the dataset to
an Ocean marketplace customer.

Description of the project and what problem is it solving: Under US law
(HIPAA, Hitech Act), healthcare companies involved in direct patient
care are required to maintain data collected by them for every patient.

Problem to be solved: Storing certain kinds of raw medical data
indefinitely / for long periods of time is expensive, especially if it
generates no returns for money spent on storage. Furthermore, this data
is locked within individual company data silos and the companies have no
mechanism to cooperate with each other to analyze this data for clinical
insights. For example, this situation is true for several different
allied healthcare companies including the intra-operative surgical
monitoring service industry in which the primary researcher (ASG) has
worked for several years.

Solution: Our goal for this proposal is to develop a *proof-of-concept*
of a data storage, analytics and monetization paradigm for aggregated
private healthcare data sourced from U.S. healthcare companies. This
paradigm will include an inexpensive, decentralized storage solution
(e.g. Filecoin), absolute control of data in the hands of the data
provider with multiple, fine-grained layers of privacy, ability to
publish dataset with compute-to-data permissions on the Ocean
Marketplace, running compute-to-data on the dataset and providing the
output to another Ocean Marketplace customer authorized by the data
provider.

Our long-term goal is to become a healthcare speclialized service
provider providing healthcare companies with storage, analytics and
moentization of their data on the Ocean Marketplace, while ensuring
patient rights and privacy. Funds requested in this proposal will allow
us to develop a proof-of concept of such a service paradigm.

Grant Deliverables: (Provide us with a check-boxed list of deliverables

/ community

Which Fundamental Metric best describes your project? Pick one.

Other - Our end goal is to unlock value in US healthcare data silos with
Ocean Protocol based technology. As a first step, we wish to create a
proof-of-concept of a paradigm to store, analyze and monetize these
datasets for their aggregators and ultimately provide control to each
patient over their own data going forward.

Core tech: We will demonstrate how the Ocean Marketplace can be
integrated with decentralized data providers like Filecoin.

Community: By establishing this paradigm for private, regulated,
healthcare data storage and monetization via the Ocean Marketplace, we
will enable the Ocean community to develop similar solutions in other
areas of healthcare as well as other regulated and privacy sensitive
communities.

What is the final product?: A proof-of-concept of a storage and
monetization paradigm using compute-to-data on privately stored
aggregate healthcare datasets.

How does this project drive value to the “fundamental metric” (listed

Expected ROI

As part of our grant deliverables, we will generate critical feedback
for the Ocean developer community to understand current data needs and
problems as understood by senior allied healthcare executives.

Expected ROI: Anecdotal reports from a health data company CEO (the
Health Unchained podcast, episode 7, Jul 2, 2018) suggest a single
health PHR (personal health record) was being sold for \~ 1200 USD in
data marketplaces. The legality of these transactions are questionable,
but indicates the value of such data. The largest neurophysiology
companies can provide services in \~ 100,000 cases a year, and the
combined case coverage for major companies based in the US Northeast is
at least 200,000 cases. If a CMO / CIO decides to use Ocean technology,
they will bring their entire database of several thousand patients to
Ocean. Although the total case volume is large, the types of cases
(e.g. neck, thorax, low back, brain aneurysms, tumors etc) being covered
are many and the patient population is varied. Hence an individual
company lacks the ability to collect sufficient data for machine
learning. Assuming a theoretical total size of 200,000 cases a year, the
total market size is 280.8 million Ocean (assuming 1 Ocean = 0.85 USD)
considering data assets alone. The hypothetical ROI based on this
valuation, results in an ROI of \>90,000 (bang/buck) with a 100% chance
of success, \>40,000 with a 50% chance, \>18000 with a 20% chance,
\>9000 with a 10% chance, \> 900 with a 1% chance of success. expected
ROI \> 900 with a 1% chance of success These are ball park estimates
based on anecdotal data, and the true price of individual PHRs after
becoming part of a dataset used in machine learning remains to be
discovered. (We thank the Coral Market team in round 10 for their
estimated ROI calculation. We have based our ROI on their logic.)

Part 3 - Proposal Details

Allied health care providers range from anesthesiology service provider
companies all the way to environmental services provider companies in
the United States. A vast army of these companies provide services to
U.S. hospitals. Many different types of companies are involved in direct
patient care and are required to store PHI data by law.

Surgical neurophysiology companies are an example of allied health
provider companies. Large neurophysiology companies are unique in having
nationwide coverage. Surgical neurophysiology companies provide their
services for surgeries involving the brain, spinal cord, peripheral
nerves and many types of vascular (involving heart, major blood vessels
including those in the brain) surgeries. There are approximately 200,000
such surgeries performed annually in the United States \[ref TBD\].

During surgery, the surgical neurophysiologist present in the operating
room records neurophysiological data from the patient and runs tests at
the request of the surgeon. This allows the surgeon to operate avoiding
injury to neural tissue. For example, during brain tumor surgeries, a
surgeon needs the neurophysiologist to guide him by identifying brain
areas involved in movement, sensation, vital bodily functions (breathing
etc). Large amounts of neurophysiological data are collected and needs
to be stored as PHI (protected health information) by the company that
employs the neurophysiologist.

The outcome of these types of surgeries are dependent on several
features of the patient’s medical history as well as the intra-operative
course of the surgery. Potentially, this data when subject to machine
learning, will unlock new insights into surgical outcomes.
Unfortunately, machine learning models are data hungry, and no
individual company can generate sufficient data on the many different
types of surgeries performed. They need to collaborate amongst each
other but are wary of this due to competition. We hope to eventually
provide a collaborative mechanism while simultaneously provide a new
revenue stream for each company in the marketplace. In addition, machine
learning developers and other entities (e.g. insurance companies) will
also benefit from compute-to-data access to real patient data.

Using their experience and connections in the surgical neurophysiology
field, the core team intends to network with large and small nation-wide
surgical neurophysiology company executives. The US Northeast, where the
core team is based, is at the forefront of this field and sets the
‘standard of service’ for other regions of the country.

Dr Ghatpande has many years of experience working in these companies and
have developed personal connections. This will allow the team to network
with these companies and understand the unique technical problems
involving neurophysiological data. The networking will specifically aim
at identifying the pain points for these companies, with respect to data
storage, handling and analytics.

Using these inputs and after consultation / collaboration with the Ocean
Protocol developer community, the team will outline legal and realistic
solution/s to these problems and propose possible analytic solutions in
subsequent one-on-one meetings with these executives. These solutions
will be based on the strengths of the Ocean Protocol tech stack,
including immutability, access tracking and compute-to-data capabilities
that preserve patient privacy. This will allow us to develop novel data
products which can serve as a revenue stream for data providers and lay
the groundwork for a US healthcare focused data marketplace based on
Ocean technology.

Project Deliverables - Roadmap Any prior work completed thus far? The
core team have actively engaged with senior neurophysiological
executives for several years and hope to leverage those connections for
this proposal. What is the project roadmap? That is: what are key
milestones, and the target date for each milestone. Questionnaire
development for allied health company executives regarding data pain
points : end of November 2021 In person / virtual detailed survey
meetings with senior executives from large allied health companies where
we will listen to current problems involving data : November / December
2021 Follow up meetings with engaged executives to outline possible
solutions using Ocean Protocol technology and highlight its advantages:
December 2021 social media (LinkedIn) posts about the new data economy
and Ocean Protocol : December 2021 Final report with analysis of the
findings : January 2022

Please include the team’s future plans and intentions.

We believe a successful implementation of data solutions in the
neurophysiology field will kindle interest amongst other types of health
provider companies (e.g. anesthesia providers that typically work
closely with surgical neurophysiologists in the operating room) and
stimulate their adoption of Ocean technology. Our end goal is to align
with / become an Ocean Protocol based b2b marketplace for healthcare
data assets and analytic solutions while ensuring patient rights and
privacy.
