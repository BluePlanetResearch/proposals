### Name of Project

**Healthcare_data_guild**

### Proposal in one sentence

Allow a private dataset, resembling **aggregated** healthcare data, to
be stored on Filecoin Plus, enclose it in a **privacy ‘bubble’**,
publish metadata on the Ocean marketplace, and provide the output of a
relevant compute-to-data algorithm run on this dataset to an
**authorized Ocean marketplace customer**.

### Description of the project and what problem is it solving

#### Problem to be solved

Under US law (HIPAA, Hitech Act), healthcare companies involved in
direct patient care are required to maintain data for every patient of
theirs. Storing certain kinds of medical data indefinitely / for long
periods of time is expensive, especially if it generates no returns for
money spent on storage. Furthermore, this data is locked within
individual company data silos. These isolated data silos lack
statistical power, and the companies have no mechanism to cooperate on
combining and analyzing this data for different insights.

For example, this situation is true for several companies that are part
of the intra-operative surgical monitoring industry in which the project
lead (ASG) has worked for several years. Each individual company has a
dataset that by itself is inadequate for machine learning algorithms,
but several such company datasets together, can provide insights. Yet
these companies are unable to share data between themselves since this
might provide crucial business intelligence to their competitors.

#### Solution

We propose a data storage, analytics and monetization **paradigm** for
aggregated private healthcare data that focuses on patient privacy, data
provenance and traceable, controlled compute-to-data. The proposed
paradigm should include an inexpensive, decentralized storage solution
(e.g. Filecoin), absolute control of data in the hands of the individual
data providing company with fine-grained layers of privacy provided by
Ocean Protocol and Datona Labs. Furthermore, the providers should be
able to publish their dataset attributes / metadata with compute-to-data
permissions on the Ocean Marketplace. A healthcare data guild- /
individual data provider- authorized customer will be allowed to run
compute-to-data ML algorithms on these datasets and to access the
predictive models / insights outputted by the algorithm. A similar
federated learning solution called [Melloddy](https://www.melloddy.eu/),
but based on centralized data storage at AWS, is currently being piloted
for large pharmaceutical companies.

Our long-term goal is to become a nationally accredited, specialized
service providing healthcare companies with storage, analytics and
monetization of their data on the Ocean Marketplace, while ensuring
patient rights and privacy. Funds requested in this proposal will allow
us to develop a *proof-of-concept* of such a service paradigm.

### Which category best describes your project? Pick one.

Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean

### Which Fundamental Metric best describes your project?

Other - Our end goal is to unlock value in US healthcare data silos with
Ocean Protocol based technology. As a first step, we wish to create a
proof-of-concept of a paradigm to store, analyze and monetize these
datasets for their aggregators and **ultimately provide control to each
patient over their own data** going forward.

Core tech: We will demonstrate how the Ocean Marketplace can be
integrated with decentralized data storage services like Filecoin.

Community: By establishing this paradigm of a dataguild of stakeholders
for private, regulated, healthcare data storage and monetization via the
Ocean Marketplace, we will enable the Ocean community to develop similar
solutions in other areas of healthcare as well as other regulated and
privacy sensitive industries (e.g. legal).

### What is the final product?

A proof-of-concept of a storage and monetization paradigm using
compute-to-data on private aggregate datasets within a specialized
dataguild of healthcare data providers, analysts and consumers.

### How does this project drive value to the “fundamental metric” (listed above) and the overall Ocean ecosystem?

#### Value added / Expected ROI

Anecdotal reports from a health data company CEO (the Health Unchained
podcast, episode 7, Jul 2, 2018) suggest a single health PHR (personal
health record) was being sold for \~ 1200 USD in data marketplaces. The
legality of these transactions are unclear, but indicates the value of
such data. The largest neurophysiology companies provide services in \~
100,000 cases a year, and the combined case coverage for companies based
in the US is \~ 750,000 [cases](https://ionm.uconn.edu/). Although the
total case volume is large, the types of cases (e.g. neck, thorax, low
back, brain aneurysms, tumors etc) being covered are many and the
patient population is varied. Hence an individual company lacks the
ability to collect sufficient data for machine learning. We expect the
Ocean, as well as, the larger AI/ML community will develop several novel
uses for this expanding healthcare dataset. If a successful dataguild of
stakeholders can be formed, a sub-ecosystem of data providers, analysts
and consumers will be created on the Ocean Marketplace contributing to
the success of the marketplace.

### Advisers

Ongoing informal discussions with several current Ocean Protocol
grantees active in the healthcare space. Consulting with the Project
guiding WG

### Proposal Details

Allied health care providers range from anesthesiology service provider
companies all the way to environmental services provider companies in
the United States. A vast army of these companies provide services to
U.S. hospitals. Many different types of companies are involved in direct
patient care and are required to store PHI (protected health
information) data by law.

Surgical neurophysiology companies are an example of allied health
provider companies. Large neurophysiology companies are unique in having
nationwide coverage. Surgical neurophysiology companies provide their
services for surgeries involving the brain, spinal cord, peripheral
nerves and many types of vascular (involving heart, major blood vessels
including those in the brain) surgeries. There are approximately 750,000
such surgeries performed annually in the United States and this case
coverage is growing every year.

During surgery, the surgical neurophysiologist present in the operating
room records neurophysiological data from the patient and runs tests at
the request of the surgeon. This allows the surgeon to operate avoiding
injury to neural tissue. For example, during brain tumor excision, a
surgeon needs the neurophysiologist to guide him by identifying brain
areas involved in movement, sensation, vital bodily functions (breathing
etc). Large amounts of neurophysiological data are collected and needs
to be stored as PHI by the company that employs the neurophysiologist.

The outcome of these types of surgeries are dependent on several
features of the patient’s medical history as well as the intra-operative
course of the surgery. Potentially, this data when subject to machine
learning, will unlock new insights into surgical outcomes.
Unfortunately, machine learning models are data hungry, and no
individual company can generate sufficient data on the many different
types of surgeries performed. They need to collaborate amongst each
other but are wary of this due to competition.

We hope to provide a private collaborative mechanism for various types
of stakeholders within this vertical. Aligning the incentives and
providing assured privacy and security for patients, data aggregators,
service providers and consumers using Ocean Protocol and Datona Labs
technology will be the primary goal. Data aggregators / providers
(neurophysiology companies) will avail of lowered storage costs as well
as a new revenue stream. In addition, machine learning developers and
data consumers (e.g. other neurophysiology companies, payors etc) will
also benefit from compute-to-data access to real patient data.

Using their experience and connections in the surgical neurophysiology
field, the built-out core team will network with large and small
surgical neurophysiology company executives. The US Northeast, where the
project lead is based, is at the forefront of this field and sets the
‘standard of service’ for other regions of the country.

Using inputs from these stakeholders and after consultation /
collaboration with the Ocean Protocol developer community, the team will
outline legal and realistic solution/s to these problems based on the
paradigm described above. The uniqueness of the paradigm resides in its
decentralized nature (no single target), immutability, access tracking
and compute-to-data capabilities that preserve patient rights and
privacy.

### Project Deliverables

#### Any prior work completed thus far?

The project lead has published two test datasets (vital_signs_1 & 2) on
the Ocean Marketplace using the Rinkeby network. He is currently working
on learning to develop and publish an appropriate compute-to-data ML
algorithm. To achieve this, he is contributing to the Algovera AI
hacking sessions actively.

#### What is the project roadmap?

The milestones will be worked on concurrently and delivery dates are an
approximate projection

Filecoin Plus storage and retrieval - End of January 2022

Publishing a private dataset resembling healthcare data and a relevant
compute-to-data algorithm on Ocean Marketplace - Feb 2022

Custom ‘bubble’ to allow multiple variations of access and permissions
for all types of stakeholders - Feb 2022

Authorized customer purchases access to the dataset with permission to
run the approved algorithm, runs the algorithm and takes delivery of the
output - March 2022

Money utilization: - consultancy fees to Datona Labs Ltd for privacy
bubble development - Filecoin Plus storage and retrieval charges -
compute services charges - addtiional development charges, if any
-contingency

#### Final delivery of proof-of-concept paradigm

end of March 2022

### Please include the team’s future plans and intentions.

We believe a successful implementation of this paradigm in the
neurophysiology field will kindle interest amongst other types of health
provider companies (e.g. anesthesia providers that typically work
closely with surgical neurophysiologists in the operating room) and
stimulate their adoption of Ocean Protocol.

Our mission is to become an Ocean Protocol based b2b service provider
for healthcare data assets and analytic solutions while ensuring patient
rights and privacy.
